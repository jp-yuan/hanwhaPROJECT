**Total: ~2,500+ lines of production-ready Python code**

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key" > .env
python main.py
```

Then test with mobile app or:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "mock-user", "message": "Help me prepare for SAT"}'
```

## 💬 Example Conversations

### Performance Analysis
```
User: "How am I doing in math?"
Agent: [Uses analyze_performance_by_topic]
       "You've attempted 45 math questions with 71% accuracy.
        Algebra: 85% (strong), Geometry: 55% (needs work)
        Would you like geometry practice?"
```

### Adaptive Quiz
```
User: "Create a quiz for me"
Agent: [Uses get_user_profile, analyze_performance, generate_adaptive_quiz]
       "Based on your performance, I've created a 20-question quiz
        focused on geometry (your weakest area). Ready to start?"
```

### Progress Tracking
```
User: "Show my progress"
Agent: [Uses get_progress_summary, track_study_streak]
       "Great work! 127 questions completed, 73% accuracy (↑ from 68%)
        5-day streak 🔥, +50 points since baseline!"
```
